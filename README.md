# Food Donation System
A system developed as a part of my Final Year Project

Web-based Food Donation System is a system that connects donor and NGO to facilitate the donation process with the help of geolocation feature. The system can help NGOs to broaden their network and gain public exposure to receive donation from the public. This system covered the donation of dry food or any food that is non-perishable. The website will be used primarily by the admin, donors, and NGOs. Donors are allowed to create and maintain individual account, view list of NGOs, view geolocation map, manage food donation, and view donation history. NGOs are also allowed to create an account, launch program, and manage food donation details. In addition, admin is able to login to the system, manage program, manage food donation, view list of NGO, and verify NGOs.
